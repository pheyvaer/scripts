## Scripts ##

This repository contains a number of (bash) scripts that I've created. They might be useful for others too. That's why I've made them available here.

- `createEPUB.sh`: creates a EPUB file from a set of folders
- `gis_runner.sh`: check multiple Git repo's at once if they contain uncomitted changes.
